# Azure: Creating Resources on the Cloud
<p>This project demonstrates how to leverage Microsoft Azure to create and manage cloud resources, showcasing both technical proficiency and an understanding of fundamental cloud concepts. Follow along as we create a Resource Group and deploy Virtual Machines within it, accompanied by detailed explanations and screenshots. ðŸ«¡
</p> 

<h2>Technologies used </h2>

- Microsoft Azure: Cloud platform for managing resources and applications <br>

-  Azure Virtual Machines (Windows and Linux [Ubuntu])

- Azure Portal: Web-based interface for cloud resource management
    
- RDP: A protocol used for remotely accessing and controlling virtual machines
  
<h2>Key Concepts</h2>

- Cloud Computing: When resources or computing services are given over the internet, allowing on-demand access and scalability

- Azure: Microsoft's cloud platform for building and managing cloud solutions

- Resource: A service like a database, VMs or storage that can be created , managed , and used in Azure

- Virtual Machine (VM): A computer within a computer, it's software that uses resources allocated to it (CPU,RAM,etc) to emulate a computer with its own operating system and applications

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

- An active Microsoft Azure Subscription will be needed to do this lab 

# Project Overview
<h2>Step 1: Create a Resource Group</h2>

<p>This will serve as a container of sorts (like a folder) that will hold our resources (Virtual Machines)</p>

- Go to Azure Portal

- Go to Resource Group

<H2>Step 2: Creating Resource (Virtual Machine)</H2>

- Return to the Azure Portal and find the "Virtual Machines" option (You can search it in the searchbar if you cant find the option in the dashboard)

- Create a virtual machine resource 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64829dcf-3278-4353-a19d-dc6f9425a77f)

- Assign the VM to the Resource Group that was created

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d101a9e4-3db9-4de2-b485-556884d23b03)

- Fill out these details:<br> 
-Virtual Machine Name<br>
-Region [!!IMPORTANT!! Make sure that the region used to create the resource group is the same as the region as the VM you are creating, might run into issues otherwise] <br>
-Image [we are going to make a Windows 10 vm so make sure to select the Windows 10 pro option for image]<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d08279c-cba8-4fa2-94d2-1f180a82f7e9)

- For optimal performance I will use 2cpus as the standard size<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08cfa758-8454-4343-9665-f5081ebfdd80)

- Create Username and password 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028d853e-63a4-4d23-938e-b3c39daa1d01)

Confirm Licensing

- Review and Create

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd270697-8d60-4b08-944e-e45ddae3e3ca)

- Virtual Machine (Windows 10 Pro) Successfully Created.<br>
Osbervations: When creating our VMs, a Virtual Network,Virtual NIC, IP Address abd Network Security Group will be automatically created.<br>[Essentially all the necessary network infrastructure so that the Vm can have its own network to transfer data locally and to the internet]

<h2>Step 3: Creating our Second Resource (Virtual Machine)</h2>

- Repeat same Steps as before to create our second VM(Linux Ubuntu server):<br>
Place vm in the same resource group as the other VM we made<br>Name VM<br>Use the same Region as the resource group<br>Choose 2cpus for the size for optimal performance<br>Select Authentication Type Password<br>Create a Username and password<br>Review and Create

<h2>Step 4: Use RDP to check if VM's are running (optional) </h2>

- Return to the Virtual Machine Dashboard in the Azure portal

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2e686dc-d035-432b-a079-18927560bc76)

- Jot down the Public IP adresses of the VM's 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a8e4a73-f175-42fb-bb68-6ba3ab1b18ba)

- If on Windows press Windows key -> Open RDP If on MAC download RDP program in APP store and put in the IP adress of one of the VM 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f159faa-a725-4e26-b101-de3f7121278e)

- Enter the Log in credentials and log in to the machine 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdd8e711-4ed7-4a70-b81a-9a21dd664c23)

- To connect to the Linux VM Remotely open up Powershell or whatever Commandline Interface your OS is using 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7844c01c-08fb-4506-903b-c14106e968f8)
 
-Type in these commands ssh (insert the username of the vm linux machine here)@(insert the IP address of the machine here) press enter

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c1cfc4b-6d81-4c77-92c9-5ffa1314af63)

- Type in the password [it will be invisible as you type it out for security purposes]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3d3ff20-007f-4a03-bd19-aff14dfcaa6e)

- You have successfully remotely and securely accessed the Linux VM through the means of SSH Yippeee<br>
To exit out of the Linux VM use the command " exit "

ðŸŽ‰Congrats we have successfully remotely logged into the VM's and confirmed that they are runningðŸŽ‰
